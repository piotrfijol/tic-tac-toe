## Description

My version of popular two-player game Tic Tac Toe. As for right now
it's only possible to play in **single-player** mode. Computer player
can be set to two difficulties: easy and unbeatable. 
* In *easy mode* AI
picks random free spot and marks it 
* In *unbeatable mode*
computer relies on minimax algorithm to minimize the maximum payoff
for the opponent ([Wikipedia's article on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax))
