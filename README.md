# Tic Tac Toe

## Description

The goal of this project is to create TicTacToe game against AI.
There are going to be two difficulty modes: Beginner and... Pro.
The former will include randomly generated numbers, the latter minmax 
algorithm. I'm planning on including webpack in this one, since
I want to make the code a bit more modular.
